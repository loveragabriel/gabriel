          Learning programming is an incredible journey that has challenged me
          to see coding in a new vision, allowing me to enjoy the learning
          process. From the fundamentals of programming to workflow and from the
          best practices and how to improve daily a clean code.
        </p>

          I&lsquo;m in this process by facing new challenges, learning new
          thecnologies and something that I love very much is the iterative
          process of improving.
